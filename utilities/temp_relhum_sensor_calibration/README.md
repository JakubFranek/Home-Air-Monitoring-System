# Temperature & Relative Humidity Sensor Calibration

The purpose of this PlatformIO-based Arduino Uno project is to take temperature & relative humidity readings using many sensors, some which will be used in the HAMS hub and nodes, in order to calibrate them.

The measured data is sent via UART to the PC serial monitor, as well as displayed on a 20x4 alphanumeric LCD display, which is useful when the calibration setup is in an airtight transparent box, powered by a battery.
